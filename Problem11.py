# problem 11
# What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20Ã—20 grid?
# 20 * 20 grid
# We are looking for four number in a row that MULTIPLIED ive the biggest number
# Note: Does this mean that the number added also give the biggest number? Is there a computational advantage?
# We do not need to know the four numbers just the result

# store the result and compare
result = 0 

# check all rows

# check all columns

# check all diagonals
